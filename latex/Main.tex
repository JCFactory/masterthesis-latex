\section{Current algorithms, solutions to predict metastasis}

\section{Overview: Apps to predict metastasis}

There already exist some applications to predict certain types of cancer worldwide, such as \footnote{\cite{iarc_predict_cancer_worldwide}}. These solutions provide several information about the tumors by showing them within many different types of charts. They do not specify on a certain patient (which would also cause problems with data privacy and protection) but explain them in general.

\section{Design Thinking Methods}

In the following sections there are explained various kinds of design strategies to find out the real needs for the application being developed. These are adopted to two basic frameworks, the IBM Enterprise Design Thinking framework \footnote{\cite{ibm_edt}} as well as the Design Kit, proposed by IDEO.ORG \footnote{\cite{design_kit}}. Some of the strategies are modified a little bit and were implemented by a single person which can affect the objectivity and diversity of the methods. Nevertheless, they generated a highly usable product and many ideas for future development cycles.

In the given figure, a vertical letter shows the initially planned goals and features of the app. The X-Axis shows the time steps whereas the Y-Axis explains the complexity of tasks. The higher on task is mentioned, the more complex it is to realize.
