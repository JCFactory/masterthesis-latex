\chapter{Abstract}\label{abstract}

This thesis tackles the problem of automated detection of inconsistencies in evolving knowledge graphs, which arise from periodic updates that affect graph elements connected to unchanged elements.
The proposed inconsistency detection approach is developed based on the analysis of a knowledge graph from the medical coding domain which is subject to annual updates. To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach, two experiments based on real- world and synthetically generated data are conducted. Three graph versioning approaches are taken into consideration for the analysis of their impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of the inconsistency detection approach. The experimental results showed that inconsistency detection can be automated by analyzing subgraphs, containing elements whose change constitutes an inconsistency source, with respect to the alteration of its elements by a periodic update. The effectiveness and efficiency of the approach depend on the graph versioning approach, the primary change type (deletion, addition, or update) and the number of inconsistency-causing changes.
This work provides an approach that facilitates targeted graph corrections and incremental updates instead of graph reconstructions by enabling cross-state graph verification without the need for a large graph-underlying data set.
